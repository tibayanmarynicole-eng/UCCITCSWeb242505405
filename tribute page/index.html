                <h2>Her Story</h2>
                <p>Eufemia I. Mamucud was a woman who fought for her life and smiled through the pain and struggles she experienced.</p>
                <p>Eufemia was the second daughter among eight girls. She was born on November 4, 1945, to Bartolome and Miguela Isla. She completed a degree in Education and later moved to work independently in Pampanga. She poured her blood, sweat, and tears into working as a waitress to a restaurant just to help support her family.
                </p>
                <p>Eufemia met the love of her life, Carlito M. Mamucud, while working. They fell in love and married on July 21, 1974. The couple was blessed with two children, Denise and Darren N. Mamucud, whom they loved dearly. They also took care of one of Eufemia's siblings, Loren Dela Cruz, and loved her like their own.
</p>
                <p>Their marriage was sacred, built on a vow to love each other forever. For decades, they stood side by side with unwavering devotion. However, on October 16, 2017, Carlito passed away from lung disease. His death was devastating for Eufemia because her husband was her other half in conquering life's challenges. Despite the overwhelming pain and grief, she forced herself to stay strong for her children, becoming both mother and father to them.</p>
                <p>Life is unpredictable, and no one can predict how long they will live. In February 2025, Eufemia was hospitalized and passed away on February 15, 2025, from cancer. She was brave enough to hide her pain, not wanting her family to worry. Eufemia will always be remembered for the kindness she showed and the love she gave throughout her 79 years of living. Her legacy is one of resilience, sacrifice, and unconditional love—a mother to all who knew her.</p>
