            <p>Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes.</p>
            <p>VS Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.</p>
            <p>Key features of VS Code include intelligent code completion, debugging support, built-in Git integration, and extensive customization options. It's designed to be fast and responsive while providing powerful development tools.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="User_Interface">
            <header>User Interface</header>
            <p>At its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.</p>
            <p>The VS Code user interface is divided into five main areas that work together to provide a seamless development experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Editor - The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally</li>
                <li>Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project</li>
                <li>Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit</li>
                <li>Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side, lets you switch between views</li>
                <li>Panels - You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated terminal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each time you start VS Code, it opens up in the same state it was in when you last closed it. The folder, layout, and opened files are preserved.</p>
            <p>You can access the Command Palette to execute commands with the following shortcut:</p>
            <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code>
            <code>F1</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Editing">
            <header>Basic Editing</header>
            <p>Visual Studio Code is a powerful editor that's easy to use for basic editing tasks. VS Code has great support for many different programming languages and has IntelliSense code completion, snippets, and much more.</p>
            <p>Here are some basic editing features you should know about to improve your productivity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple selections (multi-cursor) - Add additional cursors to select and edit text in multiple locations</li>
                <li>Column (box) selection - Select blocks of text using column selection mode</li>
                <li>Fast scrolling - Press the Alt key to fast scroll through your file</li>
                <li>Copy line up/down - Quickly duplicate lines of code</li>
                <li>Move line up/down - Reorder lines of code efficiently</li>
                <li>Find and Replace - Search and replace text with powerful pattern matching</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To add multiple cursors, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>
            <code>Alt+Click</code>
            <code>Ctrl+Alt+Down</code>
            <code>Ctrl+Alt+Up</code>
            <p>VS Code also has rich formatting support. You can format your entire document or just the current selection with the Format Document and Format Selection commands.</p>
            <code>Shift+Alt+F</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Extensions">
            <header>Extensions</header>
            <p>Extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code.</p>
            <p>You can browse and install extensions from within VS Code. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or using the View: Extensions command.</p>
            <code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code>
            <p>Popular extensions include tools for languages, themes, formatters, and productivity enhancements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ESLint - Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code</li>
                <li>Prettier - Code formatter using prettier</li>
                <li>Python - Linting, debugging, IntelliSense, and more for Python</li>
                <li>GitLens - Supercharge Git within VS Code</li>
                <li>Live Server - Launch a local development server with live reload</li>
                <li>Bracket Pair Colorizer - Color matching brackets for better code readability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To install an extension, simply click the Install button. Once the installation is complete, the Install button will change to a Manage gear button.</p>
            <p>You can search for extensions using keywords and filter by category, popularity, or rating. Extensions can dramatically enhance your development experience.</p>
            <code>ext install publisher.extension-name</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Settings">
            <header>Settings</header>
            <p>VS Code provides different scopes for settings. When you open a workspace, you will see at least the following two scopes: User Settings and Workspace Settings. User settings apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open, while Workspace settings apply specifically to the current workspace.</p>
            <p>To modify user settings, you can open the settings editor using the following keyboard shortcut:</p>
            <code>Ctrl+,</code>
            <p>You can also edit the settings.json file directly. Here's an example configuration:</p>
            <code>{
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Dark+"
}</code>
            <p>Common settings to configure include font preferences, editor behavior, and theme selection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Font size and family</li>
                <li>Tab size and indentation</li>
                <li>Auto save behavior</li>
                <li>Color theme</li>
                <li>File associations</li>
                <li>Line numbers and rulers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Settings are stored in JSON format and can be easily shared across machines or with team members. You can also create workspace-specific settings that override user settings.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Keyboard_Shortcuts">
            <header>Keyboard Shortcuts</header>
            <p>Visual Studio Code has a rich set of default keyboard shortcuts as well as allowing you to customize them. You can view all default keyboard shortcuts by opening the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.</p>
            <code>Ctrl+K Ctrl+S</code>
            <p>Here are some essential keyboard shortcuts to increase your productivity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ctrl+P - Quick Open, Go to File</li>
                <li>Ctrl+Shift+N - New window/instance</li>
                <li>Ctrl+Shift+W - Close window/instance</li>
                <li>Ctrl+X - Cut line (empty selection)</li>
                <li>Ctrl+C - Copy line (empty selection)</li>
                <li>Ctrl+V - Paste</li>
                <li>Ctrl+Z - Undo</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also search for shortcuts and add your own keybindings in the keybindings.json file:</p>
            <code>[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+c",
    "command": "editor.action.commentLine"
  }
]</code>
            <p>Custom keyboard shortcuts can help you work more efficiently by tailoring the editor to your workflow. You can bind any command to any key combination you prefer.</p>
